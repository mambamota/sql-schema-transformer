I want to create a python streamlit or gradio interface app that will be in final deployed in hugging face space in order to be used by other collegues.
the objective of the app is to 
-import and read excel file that contains old table schema structure (like ConfigurationReport-24 Old.xlsx)  for few tables
-import and read excel file that contains new table schema structure (like ConfigurationReport-23 New.xlsx)
- for both file structure, tables informations are in sheets that have name ending by _c
- the tables informations   about fields are contained starting from the row under the row containing the key word 'Custom Fields'
- the objective is to  transform an existing (entered on the interface by the user) sql query based on old structure , into a new query based on the new structure.
